== Purpose

To provide reusable automation to run ansible plays and roles against OpenShift 4 clusters

NOTE: This will always pull the latest *stable* OpenShift 4 CLI tools

== Requirements

You will need an OpenShift 4 cluster deployed with access to the kubeconfig

== Roles

* Add any addition modules to requirements.txt with `openshift` listed

=== Deploy-Operator

. Create repository secret in GitHub Settings > Secrets called KUBECONFIG that contains kubeconfig details
. Update ansible playbook called main.yaml to ensure *vars* are set
.. `ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3`
.. `OPERATOR-NAME: web-terminal`  [red yellow-background]#put operator to install here#
.. `NAMESPACE: openshift-operators`  [red yellow-background]#put namespace to install operator at here#

=== install_operator
. Create repository secret in `GitHub Settings > Secrets` called `KUBECONFIG` that contains kubeconfig details for the OCP4 cluster.
. Update ansible playbook called `main.yaml`` to ensure the operators that you wanted installed are in the `role`, formated as:
  ```
    - {name: OPERATOR_NAME, namespace: OPERATOR_NAMESPACE}
    - {name: openshift-gitops-operator, namespace: openshift-operators}
  ```

== Workflow

Once the main branch is pushed with updates to main.yaml the workflow will trigger the actions that will run *ansible-playbook*.

This is intended to simulate running Ansible playbooks to engineer, operate, or manage OpenShift 4 clusters on a bastion host.  The playbook is intended to run locally on runner and use  either `oc`, `kubectl`, or other modules that interact with OpenShift APIs or any APIs.
